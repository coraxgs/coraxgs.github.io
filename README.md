# About Corax CoLAB

**Corax CoLAB** is an independent research & engineering studio focused on building open-source solutions at the intersection of **AI, IT, Web3 and Blockchain**. We design, prototype and ship pragmatic software and hardware integrations that enable sustainable automation, decentralized systems, and developer-friendly tooling.

---

## Elevator pitch (short)
Corax CoLAB develops practical, production-ready open-source applications that combine AI-driven automation with Web3 and blockchain infrastructure — from garden-automation and sensor systems to autonomous robotics, decentralized apps (dApps) and tooling for developers.

---

## Mission
Our mission is to accelerate adoption of responsible automation and decentralization by delivering high-quality, auditable, and resource-efficient open-source software and hardware integrations. We aim to make advanced technologies accessible and useful for real-world problems — with sustainability, transparency and community collaboration as core values.

---

## What we build
We focus on four complementary domains:

- **AI & Machine Learning** — Edge-friendly models and pipelines for computer vision, predictive control and resource optimization (low-power inference on Raspberry Pi and similar hardware).
- **Automation & GreenTech** — Systems and controllers for gardens, small farms and industrial processes that reduce energy, water and nutrient usage.
- **Web3 & Blockchain** — Decentralized applications, smart-contract tooling, wallets and integration layers for trust-minimized services and tokenized incentives.
- **Developer Tooling & Infrastructure** — CLI tools, dashboards, deployment scripts and CI/CD patterns that make it easier to run reproducible systems and nodes (Cardano, Polkadot, etc.).

---

## Key principles & values
- **Open-source first:** code is public, auditable and reusable. We prefer permissive licenses where appropriate to maximize adoption.
- **Practical decentralization:** apply blockchain where it adds trust, ownership or incentives — not as an end in itself.
- **Resource efficiency:** prioritize low-power and cost-effective deployments.
- **Interoperability:** design software to play well with existing ecosystems (APIs, MQTT, Grafana, Prometheus, container runtimes).
- **Privacy and safety:** treat sensitive data carefully and avoid centralizing secrets on public pages.

## Tech stack & integrations
Typical technologies we use:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go (occasionally Rust)
- ML: TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, PlantDoc, PestNet, custom image pipelines
- Infrastructure: Docker, systemd, Raspberry Pi, ARM devices, cloud for heavier workloads
- Web: Static sites (GitHub Pages), React (for dashboards), Grafana/Prometheus for monitoring
- Blockchain: Cardano, Polkadot, smart-contract tooling and node automation
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, automated builds and release artifacts
